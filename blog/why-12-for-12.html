                <p>&emsp; &emsp;My true passion is for invention and innovation. Creating something novel, something that requires creativity and perseverance and learning new skills is the kind of struggle and payoff that I live for. Yet, in my studies, I have not had the chance to create many things. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love math, and learning new mathematical concepts is ceaselessly interesting, but pure education does not come with the same payoff that creating something novel does. Reflecting back on my experiences I have always felt this way and only recently has it risen up from my subconscious into my conscious and began to noticeably make its way into my everyday and long term decision-making. I am thankful that that drive has always been there, as it has unknowingly inspired my past projects, and now with that foundation of information I have the impetus to start making more. <br>

                &emsp; &emsp;This is the mindset that I entered 2025 with, I had the desire yet I needed a plan. I started by laying out my constraints:<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; - I am still a student, and that has to continue to be my top priority<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; - The plan must be somewhat flexible (i.e. I do not want to get stuck in any one discipline)<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; - There must be a time cap on the projects, some deadline that I can give myself to hold myself accountable<br>
                &emsp; &emsp;After viewing these constraints it became clear that having regular intervals throughout the year to produce projects would make the most sense, hence the idea of dividing the projects up by month was born. Producing one project a month, whether that is related to software development, electrical engineering, cybersecurity, media design, or another discipline would allow me to be consistent, accountable, and actually finish somewhat complex things that I can learn from. <br>
                    
                &emsp; &emsp;Therefore: 12 Projects in 12 Months / 12 for 12<br>
                    
                &emsp; &emsp;This follows all of my constraints: I can adjust the difficulty of the project depending on how much I will have to focus on school that month (i.e. I will set a simpler project for May when I will be studying for finals). I do not have to choose the project I will be doing the following month until we reach that month, allowing the flexibility to follow my desires at the time and keep my motivation high. And every month I have this website and my declarations to hold myself accountable.<br> 

                &emsp; &emsp;Check back to this website for my progress with 12 for 12. I will try my hardest to keep each projects page updated with what is going on, but I may lag behind sometimes so please forgive me.
