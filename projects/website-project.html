                    &emsp; &emsp; I am sitting here now mere minutes after laying myself bare to the internet. This website, and the first project in the 12 for 12 catalogue is published. The reason why I donâ€™t say that it is complete is simply, because it is not. Any brief exploration of the site will show that there is still much work to be done; links are broken, images are incorrectly sized, and there is no favicon. Yet, despite its flaws, it is out there for the world to tear apart. <br><br>

                    &emsp; &emsp;Creating this website has been a great dive into website building. Before this, I only had limited HTML/CSS/JS knowledge (and I would argue I still have very limited knowledge), but this has given me real experience with the ups and downs of the languages. Although I am scared of the future for the aspects of the website I have created so far have been the simpler ones, mostly manipulating text and adding images. This idea was originally done to help me refamiliarize myself with the different languages but my motivation quickly changed to the necessity of getting the website to a publishable state before the end of January. As you will see when I list the tasks I have left, a lot of them will require exploring techniques that I have never done before. <br><br>
                    
                    &emsp; &emsp;My goal with this website, and the reason that I decided to make it as the first 12 for 12 project, is as a journal of sorts. Having a reason to keep record of my progress, whether through images or written blurbs, will allow me to better reflect on what I have learned throughout my time and, to a certain extent, be able to relive fond memories of this year. <br><br>
                    
                    &emsp;- The things that I have left to make on the website are: <br>
                    &emsp;- Adding KIDS inspired graphics<br>
                    &emsp;- Fix Links<br>
                    &emsp;- Create sites for all projects<br>
                    &emsp;- Implement a favicon<br>
                    &emsp;- Make a blog post<br>
                    &emsp;- Individual site detailing 12 for 12<br>
                    &emsp;- Better self portrait<br>
