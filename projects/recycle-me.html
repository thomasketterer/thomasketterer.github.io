                &emsp; &emsp;For the February iteration of the 12 for 12 project I decided to create it over a weekend at the Hackduke hackathon. The hackathon had a few different tracks provided: interactive media, health, sustainability, and finance. We were lucky enough to have our first idea be the one that we stuck with. <br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;The impetus for this idea came from a mistake that my housemate made. The city of Carrboro, where I currently live, has a program called Recycling Stars. At random intervals, city workers will ride along with the recycling trucks in the morning and look through your recycling to make sure you are not recycling anything that was not allowed. This particular week we must have tried to recycle plastic cups and styrofoam because, right on the slip of paper they gave us, was a big OOPS! and crossed off boxes next to those respective items. This made me feel a little bad about myself. I typically think of myself as an environmentally conscious guy and  I wanted to make sure we didn’t do this again in the future. So I looked up the Carrboro municipality website and began to look around for the information, yet it eluded me. I felt like I had to search for much longer than I should have to find information that would allow me to directly help the city. This left me with a sour taste in my mouth and we ended up taping the notice up on the wall as some odd form of modern art. <br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;I was very lucky that we decided it deserved a spot on the wall as, the week before the hackathon, when I was attempting to come up with an idea to create I was reminded of my earlier dilemma and the dissatisfaction I felt. I thought to myself  “wouldn’t it be so convenient if there were an app that could scan any products barcode and tell you whether or not it could be recycled in your area?” From this was born the idea of Recycle Me, the app that uses location data and the barcode of an item and tells you the recyclability of it.<br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;Armed with our idea and more confidence than we had any right to have, we embarked on our quest for the grand prize of the sustainability track: four north face backpacks! After a great opening talk by Kyle Brown about his journey and a little information about AI, we began our coding challenge. Our four team mates: Sanat Tayal, Saanvi Arora, Nabiha Choudhury, and myself. We began, as always, with planning it out. We knew the most important part to get up and running was inputting an image and outputting a value, and features such as the geographic data, manually inputting materials, and the locations of special recycling centers could wait until later on. Our group happened to have the perfect variety of skills for this, our specialities:<br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp; - Sanat: He had experience with data science and was able to construct our data set of all the recycling laws and the algorithms to traverse it after we get the inputs<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; - Saanvi: She is very designed focused, and was able to create the website and the color direction<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; - Nabiha: Nabiha was our life saver. Her expertise in managing the backend of applications proved to be critical when designing our system. <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; - Me: I worked as the middleman. Starting out focusing on the front end I designed the communication systems, how to send the data back and forth between the front and back end<br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;While designing our idea we ran into many setbacks. First of all, there is no good database for recycling information. The closest thing we could find was a thing called the ‘Waste Wizard’ which let you input a product on a certain municipality's website and it would spit out the information we were looking for. The only problem was, the waste wizard had no API and the database they used was private. Also, they did not pull their data from a public database, they communicated directly with the cities and counties who made the rules. We were entirely in over our heads if we started to contact governments for their input, especially on a weekend. Therefore we needed a shorter term solution, and the only realistic way to do this was to do the leg work ourselves. In order to make this a realistic goal, we had to limit our scope. Therefore, we decided to only focus on making our app accessible around the triangle rather than the entire United States. Seeing this Sanat took on the challenge of collecting this information while the rest of us got to work making the application usable. For the better part of the night this was the vibe, each working on our own part and collaborating when we were planning on passing data along. This process was by no means painless, we ended up spending a good hour or two figuring out how to get the AI we were interfacing with to not say our image was too big but we eventually figured everything out. <br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;We decided to head back around 2 AM where we continued work individually until meeting back up at 6. I decided to get a cheeky single hour of sleep around 4:30 and got up just in time to meet up with Nabiha again at her dorm. From there we put the finishing touchings on our project and were able to shower before heading back to Duke for the presentation. The presentation may have been my favorite part of the entire weekend. We were able to speak to so many professionals, sharing our trials and tribulations along with our victories and reliving the weekend in a way. Unfortunately, we did not win any prizes, yet, I felt like I learned more than I ever thought I could in 24 hours,  and that was worth more than the four north face backpacks. There’s still work to be done on the project, and I hope to keep improving the recognition of the model and making other small quality of life changes to the application. <br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;It is a blessing that this project was, for the most part, completed so early in the month, as it gives me time to tie up some loose ends on other projects and get a headstart on the project for March. I still have the laundry list of things that I want to do with the website, and my March project is the largest and most complicated project yet (which might be part of a larger, multi-month project) but I will leave you to speculate over what it is. For now I will keep you in the dark and keep my nose to the grindstone.<br><br>
